					<p>
						The philosophy of the OpenCPU project is to be a foundation for
						social, open and transparent scientific computating. The software
						is designed in such a way that everything stored on OpenCPU is
						publicly readable. Furthermore we like to create an environment
						where students, researchers, analyists and anyone else feels free
						to use, reuse, modify and learn from each others code and data,
						without having to worry about copyright. The OpenCPU licensing
						reflects this principle: you agree that code and data that you
						store and publish on OpenCPU become <i>open source</i>.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						To implement this idea, OpenCPU is released under the <a
							href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU AGPLv3 </a>
						license conditions. Furthermore, code and data published through
						OpenCPU and thereby extending its functionality, are considired
						derivative works and hence should be available under AGPL
						compatible license as well. Of course you will still be the
						copyright holder of your works, and you are free to release your
						code under any additional licenses as well, either open source or
						closed source. Just keep in mind that when publishing or sharing
						code or data on OpenCPU, you give others permission to use, reuse,
						modify, etc your works.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>Note that it is allowed to use OpenCPU within an application
						that does not expose the OpenCPU API directly to the client or
						user. For example, OpenCPU could used as a computational backend
						in a similar way as e.g. a database backend like MySQL, where it
						is only accessed by the application layer. In a design like this,
						the same conditions apply: when OpenCPU is called by an
						application, you need to release any R code that is being used
						behind the scenes under an AGPL compatible license, and make it
						somehow available to your users. An good way would to release it
						in the form of an R package and publish it on CRAN or Github.</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						Also note that clients or applications that call the OpenCPU API
						are <b>not</b> considered derivative works. Hence, it ispossible
						to build a proprietary stack which interfaces to OpenCPU, as long
						as any R code is released under an AGPL compatible license. This
						way, the computations are and stay open and transparent to others,
						which is what open computing is all about!
