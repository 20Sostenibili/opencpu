									OpenCPU is a web development framework that implements some of
									the principles of Open Computing. Here are some statements
									about OpenCPU:
									<dl>
										<dt>R Web Development</dt>
										<dd>OpenCPU is the name of a web development framework
											for scientific computing based on R.
										<dt>HTTP REST API</dt>
										<dd>OpenCPU exposes a REST API to R. Client applications
											can read, write and execute R code remotely through the API</dd>

										<dt>Abstraction layer</dt>
										<dd>OpenCPU is an abstraction layer that provides a
											convenient interface to R functionality while hiding some of
											the technicalities that come with R and Statistical
											computing.</dd>

										<dt>Remove Function Calls</dt>
										<dd>OpenCPU defines a direct mapping between HTTP
											requests and R function calls.</dd>

										<dt>Open Source R-X</dt>
										<dd>Everything on OpenCPU is by definition Open Source. A
											helpful UNIX analogy: you have both Read and Execute access
											on all code that lives on the server. (And write access to
											your home dir)</dd>

										<dt>Custom code</dt>
										<dd>Conventional web services expose a limited number of
											parameterized procedures. Arbitrary code execution is
											explicitly prevented. However, in OpenCPU clients can run,
											share, execute custom code.</dd>

										<dt>Apps</dt>
										<dd>OpenCPU allows you to easily create and publish R web
											applications.</dd>

									You can use OpenCPU to power application with live statistical

									be called remotely and embedded into systems or web
									applications. <br /> For example you can use OpenCPU to do
									live forecasting of timeseries data and calculate predictive
									analytics. Use smoothing, correlations, (logistic) regression.
									Or you just need something to create a pretty plot of your
									data.

									module for the Linux kernel that enforces mandatory access
									control. This seem to work reasonably well, although the line
									between regular and malicous use can be very thin. If you are

									<p>You are asking the wrong question. OpenCPU is a cloud
										computing service. It is designed to run on its own server in
										the cloud or on some virtual machine. Once installed, you will
										be interacting with OpenCPU mostly through the API. It not
										recommended to host other software on the same server as
										OpenCPU, as R is very greedy with resources, and it is also
										unwise from a security point of view. Instead, just spin up a
										little virtual server for OpenCPU using VMWare, EC2 or
										whatever you are comfortable with.</p>

									<p>You can develop your clients or software stack in any
										language, on any operating system, as long as it speaks HTTP.
										The actual OS of the OpenCPU server is not more relevant than
										the OS on your printer or vpn server: you will rarely directly
										interact with it. That said, OpenCPU runs Ubuntu Linux. If you
										really want to port it on another OS, you're on your own.
										Especially the sandboxing can be tricky on other operating
										systems. But of course we encourage anyone to try.</p>

									An OpenCPU App is an R package that also contains a web

									you can ship both the front-end and backend of your R web
